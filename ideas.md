# Ideas

- training on a custom dataset (using real-world data)
- model retraining (when new data arrives)
- model deployment (served via an API and frontend)
- optimizations (e.g. reduced precision, flex attention)
- multi-gpu inference and training (with accelerate?)
- experiment with hardware accelerators
- agents and reinforcement learning
